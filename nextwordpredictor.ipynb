        "associated with the annotations. From this we see which positions in the source sentence were\n",

        "We can see from the alignments in Fig. 3 that the alignment of words between English and French\n",
        "is largely monotonic. We see strong weights along the diagonal of each matrix. However, we also\n",
        "observe a number of non-trivial, non-monotonic alignments. Adjectives and nouns are typically\n",
        "ordered differently between French and English, and we see an example in Fig. 3 (a). From this\n",
